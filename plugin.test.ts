/**
 * The `qol` mod's own tests, next to the mod's own code.
 *
 * They exercise the mod exactly as the game does: import its default entry
 * point, hand it resolved flags, install the result as GameState.modHooks, and
 * play a real turn through a real startGame. Nothing here reaches into core's
 * internals - it imports @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core's published API, like any third-party
 * mod's tests would.
 *
 * The complementary half is in core: packages/core/src/game/auto-dig.test.ts
 * pins what the walkBlockedByDiggable SEAM promises (an absent hook bumps and
 * draws nothing; the returned energy is spent; null falls back). This file pins
 * what the MOD does with that promise.
