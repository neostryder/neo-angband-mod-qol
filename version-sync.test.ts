 * `package.json` and `manifest.json` must carry the same version.

 * The game reads `manifest.json`, so that is the version a player installs and
 * the one a release tag matches. `package.json` is only what the build and the
 * toolchain see, which is exactly why it can drift without anything noticing:
 * it sat at 1.1.1 through the 1.2.0, 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 releases, three tags out
 * of date, and nothing failed.
